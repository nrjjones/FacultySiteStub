I am a Professor of Sociology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I study how people make decisions about migration and fertility and the implications of these decisions for population change. My current projects include the links between residential change and crime, anticipatory migration behavior, demographic responses to the diffusion of health risks, and the reconstruction of hidden population traits. My research has been funded by the NIH, NSF, William T. Grant Foundation and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. I am the Associate Director of the Center for Demography and Ecology and the Assistant Director of UW-Madisonâ€™s Health Disparities Research post-doctoral scholars program.
